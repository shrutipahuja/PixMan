Here, the user can edit the selected image with the following buttons:
- Flip Horizontally: This gives the mirror image of the original image.
- Flip Vertically: This flips the image vertically or by an angle of 180 degrees in the x-axis.
- Change Opacity: This makes the image 50% opaque.
- Add GreedyGame Text: This adds the text "Greedy Game" to the center of the image.
- Add GreedyGame Logo: This adds the GreedyGame text to the right and the GreedyGame logo to the left of the screen.
- Save Image: This saves the image to internal storage in the camera directory since DCIM dir is used. It can be accessed at the top of the camera roll. 
- Undo Changes: This un-does the last change made to the image only up to the last 3 changes.
